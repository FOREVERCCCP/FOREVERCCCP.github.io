### I'm trying to improve my English.

My goal for 2026 is to be able to talk with anyone in English.
That's why I'm writing this blog, and I'll try to update it every day.
I feel that my personality might fit overseas cultures, so I need to improve my English, especially my speaking skills.

Lately, I've gotten the impression that markets should be given higher priority than politics.

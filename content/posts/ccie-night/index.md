### I joined CCIE Night on Dec 12, 2025
What a valuable experience!

Yesterday, I attended CCIE Night and really enjoyed it.
There were some quizzes, games and many insightful discussions.

"AI Won't Replace Humans -- But Humans With AI will Replace Humans Without AI."

This phrase left a strong impression on me, and I completely agree with it.

It also struck me that many highly competant CCIE holders are working in Japan.
However, I believe that CCIE is not the goal. It's just the starting line.
It's simply a tool or a means to achieve bigger goals.

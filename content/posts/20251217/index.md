I applied for the admission ticket lottery for the Arima Kinen, which is a Grade I flat horse race in Japan.
It is the world's largest betting horse race and is held on the fourth Sunday of December each year.
I have a feeling that it might symbolically reflect my fortunes for the coming year, but I'll keep my betting within reasonable limits.
